## Abstract

Frequent pattern mining is essential for analyzing healthcare data to identify co-occurring conditions. Traditional algorithms like EPDA and Apriori are inefficient in memory usage and speed. This project addresses these challenges by:
- Using the FP-Growth algorithm to reduce memory usage.
- Leveraging Apache Spark for real-time data processing.
